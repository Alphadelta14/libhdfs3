%description
Libhdfs3, designed as an alternative implementation of libhdfs,
is implemented based on native Hadoop RPC protocol and
HDFS data transfer protocol.
It gets rid of the drawbacks of JNI, and it has a lightweight,
small memory footprint code base. In addition, it is easy to use and deploy.
.
Libhdfs3 is developed by Pivotal and used in HAWQ, which is a massive parallel
